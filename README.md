# my-seventh-assignment / Favourite Game

Deployed On Vercel - https://my-seventh-assignment.vercel.app/

I believe that I achieved everything from the requirements, as well as making it look nice with some css and media too, I gave it a go to add a like and a dislike but could not quite work out how to get those working, so I would say that I found that difficult. I used some videos and different websites to help me navigate through the things that I did not quite understand. I believe I did a good job with the css and media, and I believe that I could have spent more time learning and adjusting to supabase and added more things to it. Could I have some feedback on how you would have excecuted the like and dislike function please?
